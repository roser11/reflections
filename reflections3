I'm creating new file in Github

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks is between github repositories, clone is for your local and your github account and branches is inside a repository.

If I'm working with sb i will use fork. If i'm working alone i will use clone to get locally my github repository and i will use branch if I want to change de code, I have a new idea, something is in production...
