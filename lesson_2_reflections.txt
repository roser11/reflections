What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A new repository is created in the floder that we are. We need it to include history and files that git nit to do the control version.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area shows last changes in the repository that haven't been commited. It offers a control area for you, you don't have to worry
about what you have done yet or not.
